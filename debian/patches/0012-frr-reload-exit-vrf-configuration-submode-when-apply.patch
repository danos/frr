Subject: frr-reload: exit vrf configuration submode when applying diffs

Some commands are the same in vrf submode as they are in
global mode, such as ip route.
When frr-reload is adding global commands, they may be incorrectly
applied to a vrf because it did not exit the vrf submode before
applying them.

Ensure vrf submode commands are terminated with exit-vrf.
